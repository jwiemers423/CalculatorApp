# CalculatorApp
Calculator application that performs all the functions of a standard calculator.

The purpose of this application was to practice the use of windows forms and event handlers. 
For future additions, I plan to add scientific functions to the computer and enable the user to switch from one calculator mode to the next. I also plant to add paranthese to the calculator so solving order can be changed by the user.
